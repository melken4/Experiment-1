# Experiment-1
<p>This is an experimental exercise to see if I have a grasp of how branching works. </p>
<p>Hey, look at that, I remembered how to get here. Woohoo! It's only been 15 years...</p>
<p>I even put it a wee bit of formatting.</p>
<p><h2><b>Let's kick this in the ass.</b></h2></p>
<p></p>
<p><b>I wonder if this will make the text bold. Can't remember if this is the correct tag . . .</b></p>
<p><b>Bold</b> does work; I wonder about <i>italics<i>?
